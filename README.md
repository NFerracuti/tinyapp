# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

This version was made by Nick Ferracuti during the Lighthouse Labs' software dev bootcamp. While the code could be DRYer, and HTML cleaner, he's excited with the production of his first ever app! He hopes you enjoy. Thanks for visiting.

Big thanks to the mentors at Lighthouse Labs. Shutouts to Zuhra Bakhshi, Johnny Labedzki, and especially Shaun Purslow for patiently helping me debug and improve my understanding of code.

Also shoutout to Pedro and Alvin, Nick's instructors!
